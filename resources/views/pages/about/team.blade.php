                        It became clear very quickly that Gavin McCormack &amp; Richard Mills were on similar life journeys. <br><br>Gavin was the principal of Farmhouse Montessori School on the northern beaches in Sydney and Richard was running a unique digital agency that serviced the education sector called Digital Schools.<br><br>Both were on a mission though – and it was to create meaningful and lasting change in the world. To shape the hearts, minds and spirits of students, teachers and families and more broadly speaking, humanity. <br><br>And when the vision was born on how to scale this shared mission, it made perfect sense to team up and get to work on building Kindbox.</div>
